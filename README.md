# Spotify Features Visualizer Web App
**Project Description**: In this project, I develop a web app using `Streamlit` to visualize Spotify features of music. I also developed a separate app that allows the user to retrieve their own Spotify data to use for the visualizer app. Data can be displayed via interactive histograms, box plots, scatterplots, and polar charts with the ability compare artists, albums, and songs.

You can access the app here: [Spotify Features Visualizer App](https://johncarlomaula-spotify-features-visualizer-app-data-1jc4l8.streamlitapp.com)

To retrieve your own Spotify data, click [here](https://johncarlomaula-spotify-features-visualizer-app-data-1jc4l8.streamlitapp.com).

**Main Goals:**
- Build a web app with a user-friendly interface to visualize Spotify features
- Give the ability for users to retrieve their own Spotify data and provide some example datasets to use
- Use different visualizations such as histograms, polar charts, and scatter plots that are interactive and customizable
- Provide the ability to compare Spotify features of different artists, albums, or songs
