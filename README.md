# Spotify Features Visualizer Web App
**Project Description**: In this project, I develop a web app using `Streamlit` to visualize Spotify features of music. I also developed a separate app that allows the user to retrieve their own Spotify data to use for the main app.

To view the app to retrieve your own Spotify data, click [here]().

To view the main app for visualization, click [here]().

**Main Goals:**
- Provide the ability for users to retrieve Spotify data of their own selection of music.
- Allow users to upload their own Spotify data for visualization and analysis
- Provide several visualization options such as histograms, polar charts, or scatterplots
- Allow the ability to compare artists, albums, and songs.
- Provide an interface with instructions for usability and without the need to run code.
- Provide the ability to check out the features of the app without the need to upload their own data.
